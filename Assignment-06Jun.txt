//Assignment:
			1. Write a function ucFirst(str) that returns the string str with the uppercased first character, for instance:
			Input: "javaScript"
			Output: "JavaScript"
			
			2. Create a function truncate(str, maxlength) that checks the length of the str and, if it exceeds maxlength – replaces the end of str with three dots "...", to make its length equal to maxlength.
			The result of the function should be the truncated (if needed) string.
			Input: truncate("What I'd like to tell on this topic is:", 20)
			Output: "What I'd like to te…"
			
			Input: truncate("Hi everyone!", 20)
			Output: "Hi everyone!"
